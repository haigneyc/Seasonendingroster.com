League Charter
This league was formed out of 25% friendship, 1% for the love of football, and 75% pure idiocy.
It is a keeper league, and forever shall remain a keeper league. The league was formed by Commissioner Chris Haigney and consisted of 9 founding members. Matt Altman, Matt Winter, Ian Lane, John Condon, Matt Condon, Dave Slater, Joe Trendowski, Peter Ott, and Matt Verone. Following the 2004 season, Matt Condon parted ways from The League. Greg Cupelo took control of his team. In 2008, The League expanded to 12 teams and added Mike Lane and Mike Sterbank as managers. In 2015, founding member Joe Trendowski resigned from his position as manager and his team was restationed to Matt Condon. In 2017 Greg Cupelo left the league to manage the Camillus Dump. His team was given over to the LA-based, award winning writing duo of Brian Kratz and Josh Corey.
This is a competitive league and each manager is expected to manage his team to the best of their abilities (as they see fit).
All members agree to follow these specified rules.  Any issues not addressed in this document will be voted upon and then the charter will be updated to reflect said change.  This Charter is worth its weight in Guinness.
